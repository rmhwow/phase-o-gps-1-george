##GPS 1.1 Reflection

#####What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Well these are things I found I was struggling with when Morgan pointed out to me what they actually meant: 
` Git status `- I thought it checked your branch against the master branch on GitHub, she corrected me that it just checked for unstaged and uncommited changes. 
` Merge Conflicts ` I was afraid to mess around with merge conflicts by myself, I didn't want to lose my ever so valuable files/changes. Morgan did a great job of walking me through merge conflicts and it's really unscary and easy. 

#####What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I answered this in the last question.

#####What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

It was just Morgan (the guide) and myself. I asked her a lot of questions about version control, her experience at DBC, her life. 

#####What still confuses you about git?

I'm still afraid of making a huge mess with branches and messing with the master branch. Writing this out though makes me realize that I need to go make these mistakes and experiment. 



######How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
Overall very positive. Like I mentioned earlier my pair didn't show up, so it was just me and the guide, but we had a good time together and she taught me a lot. Very cool! (insert cake emoji)
